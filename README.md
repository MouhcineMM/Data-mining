# Titanic Survival Prediction Model

This project aims to build a predictive model to determine the survival probability of passengers aboard the Titanic using various machine learning algorithms. The algorithms explored include Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Hyperparameter tuning is performed using grid search to optimize model performance.

## Process Overview:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** 
   - Data cleaning and handling missing values.
   - Feature engineering and transformation.
   
2. **Data Splitting:** 
   - Division of data into training and testing sets.

3. **Model Training:**
   - Utilization of Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, and KNN algorithms.
   - Hyperparameter tuning using grid search.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Assessment of model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. **Model Selection:**
   - Choosing the best-performing model based on evaluation results.

6. **Deployment:**
   - Deployment of the selected model for making predictions on new data.
