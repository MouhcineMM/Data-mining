Titanic Survival Prediction Model
This project aims to build a predictive model to determine the survival probability of passengers aboard the Titanic using various machine learning algorithms. The algorithms explored include Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Hyperparameter tuning is performed using grid search to optimize model performance.

Process Overview:
Data Preprocessing:

Data cleaning and handling missing values.
Feature engineering and transformation.
Data Splitting:

Division of data into training and testing sets.
Model Training:

Utilization of Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, and KNN algorithms.
Hyperparameter tuning using grid search.
Model Evaluation:

Assessment of model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Model Selection:

Choosing the best-performing model based on evaluation results.
Deployment:

Deployment of the selected model for making predictions on new data.
